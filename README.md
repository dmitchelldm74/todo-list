# TODO List Backend
This backend is for a TODO list native app. The backend should implement several features.

For version 1 of the API, a user should be able to:
- Get a unique user id.
    - This id is the id for the "account" that the TODO lists are saved to.
- Create/Delete/Update their TODO lists
- Add/Update/Remove TODO list items
